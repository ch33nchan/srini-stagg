This file, constants.py, is part of the zoo_envs package and serves as a centralized location for defining constants used throughout the package. Here's a brief overview of its contents and significance:
Movement Constants: It defines constants for movement directions (STILL, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and groups them into a list called MOVES. These are likely used to control or represent movement within the environment.
2. Visual Constants:
TILE_SIZE defines the size of each tile in the environment.
BACKGROUND_COLOR, CLEAR, GRID_LINE_COLOR, and SCREEN_SIZE are used for visual settings, such as the background color, transparency, grid line color, and screen dimensions.
3. Color Constants:
STAG_COLOR, PLANT_COLOR, and AGENT_COLORS define RGB color values for different entities or agents in the environment. These are used to visually distinguish different elements.
Sprite Paths:
Paths to image files for various sprites (e.g., STAG_SPRITE, PLANT_SPRITE, HARE_SPRITE, etc.) are defined using pathlib.Path. These paths are used to load images for rendering entities in the environment.
5. Sprite Dictionary:
SPRITE_DICT maps agent identifiers to their corresponding sprite paths, allowing for easy retrieval of the correct sprite for each agent.
The significance of this file lies in its role as a configuration hub for the visual and movement aspects of the zoo_envs package. By centralizing these constants, the file promotes maintainability and consistency across the codebase, making it easier to update or modify these settings without having to change multiple parts of the code.
