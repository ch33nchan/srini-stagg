10-17 appears that I was repeatedly running on one_hot_2 vs one_hot_3

24-29 testing one hot encoding 0, 1, 2 against reset simplified

58-61 try poisoned and simplified

62-69 try poison death and punishment and know poisoning

70-76 try different observation again

78-81 try if three agents rid the stag

84 relative_3 + poison = poison_2

85 - 91 try different observation again when agent rids stag

95 try adi settings with evaluation

96 - 97 same but reset simplified

98 - 103 try different observation again

104 - 106 try again for relative_4

107 poisoned_stag with new logic

110 poisoned_2, find out only needing one agent to capture poisoned stag better

111 poisoned_2 with limited observation

112 - 117 try have context or not and stag poison chance 3,5,7

122 train on constrained env, eval on complex env

123 try 0.2 clip param on one_hot_2

124 - 128 try different possibility of stag poison chance, with 0.3 clip
